HiBitQuant is a software tool for quantifying protein concentrations of HiBit-tagged proteins using luminescence kinetics experiments from Synergy plate readers. It directly takes these plate reader outputs and allows the user to specify condition information using a GUI. HiBitQuant then graphs the kinetic traces and quantifies protein concentrations based on predefined standard curves. HiBitQuant also has built in tools for creating new standard curves.
